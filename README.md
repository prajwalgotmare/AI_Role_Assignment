#Project Description

This project involves processing a video file of a task (regarding ball detection) solved using OpenCV in Python. The project was developed using Jupyter notebook and Python 3.

Video Conversion : 

The provided input video was labelled as "AI Assignment video" and had a variable frame rate mode of 30.043 fps as found in the metadata of the video. Therefore, the video was first converted to a constant frame rate mode with a dimension of 1280 * 720 and fps = 30. 
I have used openshot video editor to convert "Ai assignment video.mp4" to video named as "original formated.mp4"
(For more file comparison you can check Videos_Metadata_comparison.txt above)

Code Execution
The code can be executed in the Jupyter notebook named "ROI_Coordinates_and_color_ranges.ipynb". Before executing the code, ensure that the required text file named "Ball_info.txt" is saved in the local folder.
